Kaikoura Earthquake

Until the early 1990â€™s, it was recognized that topography and surface deformation could be measured using spaceborne radar interferometry (InSAR). The advantages of this technique are best applied to displacement caused by earthquakes, subsidence, volcano uplift phenomena and glaciers. Spatial and temporal resolutions are so accurate that surface displacement in the vertical and horizontal directions will be captured down to centimeter level accuracy.

Application of this technology in PNG for landslide mapping using this technique would be advantageous in identifying potential high-risk areas relating to human settlement and economic infrastructure such as the highlands highway. It is this sort of information that will help government agencies in planning for mitigation and adaptation measures.

Vertical surface displacements using interferometry for the earthquake displacement at Kaikoura in New Zealand was measured. Each fringe (arbitrary color) represents a vertical displacement in centimeters, so by counting each one will yield the total vertical displacement.
