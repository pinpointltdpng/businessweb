Ideal Rooftop Solar Potential Location

Determination of Solar potential was performed using ArcGIS model builder which is a visual programming language for building workflows through combining several tools such as slope, aspect, zonal statistics, joins etc. We utilized building footprints and the DSM as model inputs to provide the basis for automation required in scaling up analysis for the project to cover other buildings. We were able to determine the ideal locations of the Pavilion rooftop for installing solar panels that yielded the most solar potential indicated as red grid cells.
