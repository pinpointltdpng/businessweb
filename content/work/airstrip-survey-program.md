Graphical User Interface

Built using the Tkinter python package for GUI development, the Airstrip Survey program is a user-friendly GUI interface that shows 8 variables which guides the user to input airstrip survey data. It was developed to target technical personnel in the aviation industry in Papua New Guinea.

Airstrip surveyors in the past have been using sheets of printed paper to collect airstrip information and on these survey trips, they are exposed to the natural elements of nature. Sheets of paper would either get smudged, disintegrate under wet weather conditions or get blown away by wind if not bounded well. There was also, the tendency to accrue a clutter of survey papers when multiple airstrips where surveyed, which usually was the case. The old process for these airstrip surveyors was that after each survey trip, these survey sheets would then be transferred manually into excel or csv to build a database of the airstrips in the country and to use that to plot on map.

The benefits of the Airstrip Survey program will improve the performance of surveyors in the field and in the office by eliminating the manual entry and protect the data against the natural elements. It makes it possible to digitize on the go and automated the whole process efficiently.
