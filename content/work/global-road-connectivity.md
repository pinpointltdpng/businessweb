Space syntax is a set of theories and statistical methods that are used to model and analyse movement within cities. This small project applies that theory to model and analyse the street network of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea* within a 10km radius from the CBD. The analysis was able to predict road segments that would have high volume of traffic indicted by the warm/ or hot colors in the map. Interestingly, this closely mirrors the busy routes experienced in the city. Areas of cooler colors show road networks that are segregated, hence less volume of traffic.
