      <description>About Heading  The business was founded by Charlie Arua Ikosi, a young geospatial graduate from the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand after having returned to Papua New Guinea in March 2022. With low employment rates in the country, Charlie decided to utilize his skills and knowledge in geospatial science by starting the business which would enter the GIS and consulting field by employing himself at Pinpoint.
